# POOP-Lang
POOP lang (pythonesque object oriented programming language)
# Documentation
# Types and datastructures
Variables in POOP lang are set with the `turd` keyword. Take this example:

```stringy turd name = "finn"```

The syntax for variables goes as follows:

<code>_type_ turd _variable name_</code>

POOP lang is a statically typed language. Here are the different types:

the `runny` type is used for floating point numbers

the `chunky` type is used for integers

the `stringy` type is used for string literals

the boolean types are represented by the `shart` keyword. True is represented by `shit` and false with `fart`

lists are represented by the `diarrhea` keyword. `diarrhea` can only contain `turd`.
